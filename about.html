			<p>Are you looking for the best cafes in Kolkata? So, you are in the right place. As you know, the
				gastronomic scene in Kolkata has always been high and now it’s improving more and more.
				The most cosmopolitan city in India, Kolkata cafe has the most assorted food culture. From streetside
				food to authentics and everything in the middle, individuals of Kolkata are spoilt with decisions.

				There are rich tastes and great flavors for a wide range of eaters, from erotic to insatiable guts and
				everything in the middle. With another bistro opening around the square consistently, you have the
				choice of not venturing inside a similar put at any point down the road and continuing to another
				one.<br>
				Many special and local chefs are bringing the world’s flavors into this city. And, they are merging them
				with the local culinary scene. The restaurants, Cafes, and bars become much more refined and improving
				themself because of the knowledge of full chefs. So, let’s check the cafes in Kolkata.
				The City of Joy is one of the hotspots of the universally famed Indian cuisine, simply because of all
				the
				culinary influences that have converged here over the centuries. Being a coastal city, there was never a
				shortage of seafood and it has always been a staple here. But, then when the Mughals arrived and brought
				with them the delight of spices, the game of Kolkata food was upped. Followed by the British who made it
				their seat of power for a good two centuries, during when they further diversified the taste of Kolkata.
				Somewhere during that time, the Chinese immigrants arrived and really revolutionized the Indian food
				scene with their flavours. The first taste of Indo-Chinese food was the gift of Kolkata to the rest of
				the country, and it has evolved into a fully developed international cuisine unto its own since
				then.</p>
